    A[User lands on homepage] --> B[User clicks 'Ask Your PDF']
    B --> C[Navigate to /chat page]
    C --> D[User uploads PDF file]
    D --> E[File processing & vectorization]
    E --> F[User asks questions]
    F --> G[AI retrieves relevant context]
    G --> H[Generate contextual response]
    H --> I[Display answer to user]
    I --> F
```

    U->>F: Upload PDF
    F->>B: POST /upload/pdf
    B->>P: Extract text from PDF
    P->>B: Return extracted text
    B->>V: Store text chunks as vectors
    V->>B: Confirm storage
    B->>F: Return success response
    
    U->>F: Ask question
    F->>B: POST /chat
    B->>V: Search similar vectors
    V->>B: Return relevant chunks
    B->>A: Send question + context
    A->>B: Return AI response
    B->>F: Send formatted answer
    F->>U: Display response
```
